# This implementation appears more complex than it needs to be be, but this is
# because it is not trivial to support observing cyclic structures in a robust
# way. If you're thinking "I could rewrite this in half the code," ask yourself
# if your simpler solution would handle that case. If so, please file a pull
# request!

# I opted to solve the cyclic problem by attaching to each callback a predicate
# that asks each observation "to the left of it" if it is watching the same slot
# already. If so, it simply doesn't fire.

# `allowFirst` exists to distinguish between the initial callback invocation
# (since `slot.subscribe` calls the callback immediately) and subsequent
# invocations by `slot.set`. We only want to guard the latter case, or else the
# observation stack won't be set up correctly.
